# Dropzone + Sortable

This repo is to show how Dropzone and Sortable can be knitted together to create a dynamic fully functional uploader

# Setup
 1. make sure npm is installed
 2. run npm install
 3. run local server and php

# Summary
This repo also explains how to upload multiple files and then rename those files according to the order of sort. 
When images are re sorted, their names starting with the order gets updated.

This functionality logic can be seen from line 68 to 81
